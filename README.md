# WiFire API documentation. For partner applications to access WiFire's public WiFi database

You will need a username and password to access this service. Please email wifire.bizdev@mobstac.com to get credentials generated and assigned to your organization.

## Making a request

All URLs start with https://wifireapi.mobstac.com/api/v1/. We use HTTP Basic auth for request authorization.

*NOTE:* All API requests must come from a pre-whitelisted public IP address that belongs to your server. Your API key is tied to the IP address, so requests from other IPs are automatically rejected.

We also rate-limit API requests to ensure you don't overload our server.
